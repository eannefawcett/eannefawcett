Hello! I'm currently working on a few different projects. Currently I am streaming the management of and execution of a logistic regression model in the chemistry domain. Also I am working on a couple of other side projects that include: a computer vision project in the domain biochemistry, a dice rolling project in the table top gaming domain, and publishing my past completed web applications to my website. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
